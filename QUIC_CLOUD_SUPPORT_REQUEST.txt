## Account Information

**Email:** chessgenius900@gmail.com
**Domain:** techjobs360.com
**Issue:** Site completely down with 503 errors

---

## Problem Description

My website techjobs360.com has been down for several days with continuous 503 Service Unavailable errors.

**Technical Details:**
- Error: `upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers`
- SSL Error: `BAD_ECC_CERT` (TLS error)
- QUIC.cloud CDN cannot connect to origin server due to SSL certificate mismatch

---

## What I Need

**URGENT: Please make these changes to my techjobs360.com CDN configuration:**

1. **Change SSL mode to "Flexible SSL"** (or "HTTP to Origin")
   - Current setting is probably "End-to-end HTTPS" or "Full SSL Strict"
   - This is blocking connection due to invalid certificate on origin
   - Need to bypass SSL verification temporarily

2. **Purge all cached content**
   - Clear any cached 503 errors
   - Flush all CDN cache for techjobs360.com

3. **Verify origin server connectivity**
   - Check if origin server IP is correct
   - Verify origin is responding

## Impact

- Website completely inaccessible
- Business operations halted
- Automated job posting system offline for days
- Critical business need - losing revenue daily

---

## Urgency Level

**CRITICAL** - Site has been down for multiple days. Need immediate assistance.

---

## Temporary Workaround Request

If SSL configuration cannot be changed immediately, please temporarily:
- Disable CDN proxy (DNS only mode)
- OR bypass SSL verification
- So site becomes accessible while proper fix is implemented

Please respond ASAP. I am available immediately for any troubleshooting.

Thank you for urgent assistance.
